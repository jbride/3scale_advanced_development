## Business Case

You are a consultant assigned to WebRetail Inc., an e-commerce hosting platform. They are developing a new online retail platform branded "CoolStore" through which their partners can provide a catalog and inventory to sell products through the platform.

WebRetail Inc. is adopting a new microservices architecture and wants to make its retail platform APIs available as REST APIs. It has asked you to lead a proof-of-concept (POC) using Red Hat 3scale API Management. The purpose of the POC is to determine the feasibility of using 3scale API Management for managing WebRetailâ€™s APIs, providing a standard portal for its partners to access the APIs, setting up partner tier-based plans, providing standard API documentation, and automating signup for the developers.

## Business Service

WebRetail Inc. has made its CoolStore microservices project available to you:

* Microservices: https://github.com/jbossdemocentral/coolstore-microservice

* Additional collateral: https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/3scale_development_labs/tree/master/CoolStore

## Environment Details

Two APIs was created in 3scale platform to manage both microservices that WebRetail has. The first one is Inventory Service, that has 2 Applications plans: Inventory Service Basic and Inventory Service Premium. And the another one is Catalog Service and has the Application plans: Catalog Service Basic and Catalog Service Premium.

The default API definition was deleted to be sure that it won't be available througt the Developer Portal.

By configuration reasons, was created applications with both APIs basic plans linked to the default developer organization.

  });
</script>
```

### Partial shared/swagger_ui

Was completely changed by the following content:

```liquid
<div class='apidocs-param-tips apidocs-signin-message' style='display:none;'>
    <p><a href='#'>Sign in</a> to your account for quick access to useful values.</p>
</div>

{% for api in provider.api_specs %}

<div class="swagger-section">
    <div id="message-bar-{{ api.system_name }}" class="swagger-ui-wrap">&nbsp;</div>
    <div id="swagger-ui-container-{{ api.system_name }}" class="swagger-ui-wrap"></div>
</div>

{% endfor %}

<script type = "text/javascript" >
  $(function() {
    {% for api in provider.api_specs %}
    
    window.anotherSwaggerUi = new SwaggerUi({
      url: "{{ api.url }}",
      dom_id: "swagger-ui-container-{{ api.system_name }}",
      supportedSubmitMethods: ['get', 'post', 'put', 'delete', 'patch'],
      onFailure: function(data) {
        console.log("Unable to Load Sentiment-SwaggerUI");
      },
      docExpansion: "list",
      transport: function(httpClient, obj) {
        console.log("[swagger-ui]>>> custom transport.");
        return ApiDocsProxy.execute(httpClient, obj);
      }
    });
    window.anotherSwaggerUi.load();

    {% endfor %}
  }); 
</script>
```

### Raptorize Jquery plugin

To enable that go to the rapitorize page and download the kit, and create each file in the `.Root` path of Developer Portal. Is important that the file name was declared in the **Path** input.
