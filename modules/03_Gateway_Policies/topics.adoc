Transcript:


This module discusses some of the advanced features of 3scale API Management. The topics include usage of plans beyond the default Application Plan, e.g Account Plans, Service Plans and End user plans. We will also look at creating alerts and notifications based on certain events. The use of 3scale Command Line Inteface for importing services based on their Swagger or RAML specification is also discussed. We will discuss customizations required for using custom email templates. Finally, we will look at the use of multiple gateways, and dividing the traffic for specific services to use certain apicast gateways.
