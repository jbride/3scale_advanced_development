== API Service Discovery Lab

.Goals

* Use 3scale API Management's gateway to connect to OData services
* Use 3scale Service Discovery to discover an OData service running on OpenShift

:numbered:

== Overview

In this section of the lab, you deploy an OData (Open Data Protocol) based application to your OpenShift environment.

Afterwards, this application will be auto-discovered by the 3scale API Manager running on the same OpenShift cluster.
Upon discovery of this OData application, the 3scale API Manager will generate an initial skeleton of a 3scale _API_ to manage the RESTful OData endpoint.

As you work through this lab, consider when and why you may opt to utilize this _auto-discovery_ feature of 3scale as well as its trade-offs.


== OData Service Management

link:http://www.odata.org/[OData] is a standard that defines a set of best practices for building and consuming RESTful APIs. 
The service you deploy is based on a Red Hat Data Virtualization for OpenShift Container Platform virtual database (VDB). 
This VDB has a virtual view that retrieves data from two database tables (MySQL and PostgreSQL) and presents them as a single SQL ANSI table. 
Then, out of the box, this view is exposed in Red Hat Data Virtualization as an OData REST service. 
You can find more information here:

* link:https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/data-virtualization[Red Hat Data Virtualization]

* link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_data_virtualization/6.3/html/red_hat_jboss_data_virtualization_for_openshift/[Red Hat Data Virtualization for OpenShift].


NOTE:  Red Hat Data Virtualization is no longer a stand-alone product.  Instead, it is now being sold as part of a subscription to Red Hat Fuse.

=== Deploy Stock API Project to OpenShift

In this section you deploy a backend business service called the:  _Stock API_.
The _Stock API_ service is a JEE application that runs in a JBoss EAP container on OpenShift. 

The _stock data_ (which the _Stock API_ exposes)  exists in two databases: MySQL and PostgreSQL. 
Red Hat Data Virtualization is used to provide data virtualization and present the combined data view as an OData REST service.

. At the terminal, ensure you are logged into your OpenShift environment using the *oc* utility.
. Create a new project for your Stock API business service applications:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc new-project $OCP_USERNAME-stock-api \
     --display-name="Stock API ODATA" \
     --description="Stock API ODATA Services"
-----

. Import the `stock-api` template into your OpenShift environment:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc create -f $HOME/lab/3scale_development_labs/templates/stock-api.json
-----

. Add the `datasources` environment variable secret to the project:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc create secret generic \
                   datavirt-app-config \
                   --from-file=$HOME/lab/3scale_development_labs/Stock/datasources.env
-----

* Note that `datasources.env` includes all of the needed configurations to define JDBC-based datasource pools to both the MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.

. Create a new service account for the `datavirt` user and provide view access:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc create serviceaccount datavirt-service-account
$ oc policy add-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:$OCP_USERNAME-stock-api:datavirt-service-account
-----

. Create the new application using the `stock-api` template:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc new-app --template=stock-api --param HOSTNAME_HTTP=stock-api-$OCP_USERNAME.$OCP_WILDCARD_DOMAIN
-----

. Wait until all of the pods have successfully deployed:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc get pods

NAME                  READY     STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
stock-api-2-34b7h     1/1       Running     0          16h
stockmysql-3-3g5v9    1/1       Running     0          18h
stockpg-5-j8181       1/1       Running     0          18h
-----

. Once the API and the database pods are running, test the `odata` service by making a request to the endpoint:
+
[source,texinfo]
-----
$ curl -k http://`oc get route stock-api --template {{.spec.host}} -n $OCP_USERNAME-stock-api`/odata4/Stock-API/FederatedStock/stock?$format=JSON
-----
+
.Sample Response				
[source,texinfo]
-----
{"@odata.context":"$metadata#stock","value":[{"productid":1,"amount":20.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":1,"amount":30.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":2,"amount":30.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":2,"amount":14.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":3,"amount":1.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":3,"amount":40.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":4,"amount":14.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":4,"amount":100.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":5,"amount":22.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":5,"amount":2.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":6,"amount":880.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":6,"amount":10.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":7,"amount":1200.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":7,"amount":32.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":8,"amount":532.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":8,"amount":1.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":9,"amount":10.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":9,"amount":123.0,"storeid":2},{"productid":10,"amount":1.0,"storeid":1},{"productid":10,"amount":730.0,"storeid":2}]}[sjayanti@localhost camel-webservice-fis]
-----

* The REST `odata` service is now correctly deployed, and you can begin to configure the APIcast gateway to use this REST endpoint to communicate with the service.


== Create APIcast Gateway Staging and Production Routes

. Verify that you are in the APIcast gateway project:
+
-----
$ oc project $GW_PROJECT
-----

. Create new routes for the Stock API staging and production APIcast gateways:
+
[source,sh]
-----
$ oc create route edge stock-odata-staging-route \
  --service=stage-apicast \
  --hostname=stock-odata-staging-$OCP_USERNAME.$OCP_WILDCARD_DOMAIN \
  -n $GW_PROJECT

$ oc create route edge stock-odata-production-route \
  --service=prod-apicast \
  --hostname=stock-odata-production-$OCP_USERNAME.$OCP_WILDCARD_DOMAIN \
  -n $GW_PROJECT
-----


== 3scale Service Discovery 

As of version 2.4 of the 3scale product, it has the ability to auto-discover OpenShift _services_ so as to auto-generate API resources in 3scale.

As you will see in this section of the lab, these OpenShift _services_ need to include several specific _labels_ and _annotations_ for this discovery mechanism to work.
In addition, the `default` service account of the 3scale API Management namespace (typically owned by a OpenShift cluster admin)  needs view access to the entire cluster. 
This configuration needs to be executed by the OpenShift cluster administrator.

In your lab environment, the cluster admin has already done this for you.
[TIP]
====
For informational purposes only, the following command is used by the cluster administrator to provide the required view access:

[source,sh]
-----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user view system:serviceaccount:3scale-mt-api0:default
-----

You do not need to execute the above command at this time.
====

See link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_3scale_api_management/2.4/html/service_discovery/service-discovery-configuration-procedure#making-service-discoverable[Service Discovery] for details on this new 3scale by Red Hat feature.


NOTE:  With 3scale 2.4, there is a known problem when executing this section of the lab using Google Chrome as your browser.
The JavaScript that retrieves and renders the list of discovered APIs breaks in certain versions of Chrome.
Subsequently, if using some versions of Chrome you will not see the list of APIs.
Please try upgrading to the latest version of Chrome.
If that still does not help, then please switch to the Firefox browser.

=== Set Up OData Service for Discovery

. Edit the `stock-api` service in the `$OCP_USERNAME-stock-api` OpenShift project:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc edit svc stock-api
----

. Add the following line under `labels`:
+
[source,texinfo]
----
    discovery.3scale.net: "true"
----

. Add the following lines under `annotations`:
+
[source,texinfo]
----
    discovery.3scale.net/scheme: http
    discovery.3scale.net/port: "8080"
    discovery.3scale.net/path: 
    discovery.3scale.net/description-path: 
----
+
NOTE: The _description-path_ annotation is currently left blank because the OData RESTful backend service currently does not expose _OpenAPI_ documentation.
If it did and this annotation was populated, then upon discovery of this OpenShift _service_, 3scale would auto-generate corresponding 3scale _ActiveDocs_ from this _OpenAPI_ documentation.

.. YAML is very white-space sensitive.  Ensure that when adding these labels and annotations, the indentations are correct.
.. The modified service should be similar to the following:
+
-----
...

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    description: The data virtualization services.
    discovery.3scale.net/port: "8080"
    discovery.3scale.net/scheme: http
    openshift.io/generated-by: OpenShiftNewApp
  creationTimestamp: 2019-02-05T13:13:34Z
  labels:
    app: stock-api
    application: stock-api
    discovery.3scale.net: "true"
    template: stock-api
    xpaas: 1.4.0
  name: stock-api

...
-----
