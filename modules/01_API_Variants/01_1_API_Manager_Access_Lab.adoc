== Lab Assets

The lab assets for this course are version controlled at:  `https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/3scale_development_labs.git`

You can clone these lab assets to your local machine as follows:

-----
$ mkdir -p $HOME/lab

$ git clone https://github.com/gpe-mw-training/3scale_development_labs.git $HOME/lab/3scale_development_labs
-----

== Environment Variables

Open a terminal window in your local machine and set the following environment variables that will be used throughout the duration of this course.

-----
# Modify each of the following based on settings provided by Instructor
# Afterwards, exeecute each of the modified commands in your shell:

echo "export REGION=<provided by your instructor>" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID=<provided by your instructor>                          #   Name of API Manager administrator " >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export OCP_USERNAME=<provided by your instructor>" >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export OCP_PASSWD=<provided by your instructor>' >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export API_TENANT_USERNAME=<provided by instructor>                            #   Name of tenant admin " >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export API_ADMIN_ACCESS_TOKEN=<provided by instructor>                         #   Access token specific to tenant to invoke 3scale Admin APIs" >> ~/.bashrc


#  Review, copy & paste the following in same terminal #

echo "export API_MANAGER_NS=3scale-mt-\$OCP_AMP_ADMIN_ID                                #   Name of OCP namespace where API Manager resides "   >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export GW_PROJECT=\$OCP_USERNAME-gw                                               #   Name of OCP namespace where API gateways resides" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export API_RESPONSE_DIR=$HOME/lab/amp_api_responses                               #   Name of local directory where responses from invoking 3scale admin API will be stored" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export OCP_WILDCARD_DOMAIN=apps.\$REGION.openshift.opentlc.com                    #   OCP Wildcard DNS" >> ~/.bashrc


# Execute the following to enable the variables in your existing shell
source ~/.bashrc

== Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform

The instructor of this course will have provisioned an OpenShift cluster environment to support this enablement.

All labs for this course will execute in this remote OpenShift cluster environment.

=== OpenShift Web Console

. The OpenShift web console can be accessed by pointing your browser to the following url:
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n\nhttps://master.$REGION.openshift.opentlc.com\n\n"
-----
+
At the login prompt, use the values of `$OCP_USERNAME` and `$OCP_PASSWD`

. Determine the version of the OpenShift cluster:
.. Navigate to question mark icon in the top right of the Web Console and select `About`.
+
image::images/ocp_version.png[]

=== `oc` utility tooling

The OpenShift `oc` client utility will need to be installed on your host laptop.

The version of the `oc` utility should be of the same major version as the OCP shared cluster environment provisioned by your instructor.

If you do not already have a compatible version of the `oc` utility installed on your host machine, then you can retrieve it by navigating to the following in the OCP Web Console:

. Navigate to the question mark icon in the top right of the Web Console and select: `Command Line Tools`
. Under `Download oc`, click the `Latest Release` link
. Doing so will redirect your browser to a page that allows for selection of a specific version for each type of operating system (Linux, OSX, Windows).

Once you've installed the oc utility, log in to Openshift using the oc utility.

----
$ oc login https://master.$REGION.openshift.opentlc.com -u $OCP_USERNAME -p $OCP_PASSWD
----

=== OCP Projects

. Once you have authenticated in, you should see two OpenShift projects :
+
-----
$ oc get projects

...

3scale-mt-amp0   3scale-mt-amp0   Active
user1-gw                          Active
-----

.. *3scale-mt-amp0*
+
Your OCP user has been provided with _view_ access to the central multi-tenant API Manager.

.. *$OCP_USERNMAE-gw*
+
This namespace includes an API gateway pre-configured to interact with your API Management tenant.


== Multitenant 3scale API Manager

Your lab environment includes access to a multi-tenant 3scale API Manager installation.

For the purpose of this lab, you will serve as the administrator of your own 3scale _tenant_ (aka: _domain_)

. To access the admin portal of your 3scale environment, point your browser to the output of the following:
+
-----
$ echo -en "\n\nhttps://`oc get route $OCP_USERNAME-$API_MANAGER_NS-provider --template {{.spec.host}} -n $API_MANAGER_NS`\n"
-----

Login credentials are as follows:

. *Username*:  $API_TENANT_USERNAME
. *Password*:  admin


== API Gateways

=== API Manager Gateways

Your 3scale API Manager multitenant lab environment does come with a set of associated staging and production apicast gateways.

These gateways can be seen by executing the following:

-----
$ oc get dc -n $API_MANAGER_NS | grep apicast


apicast-production        1          1         1         config,image(amp-apicast:latest)
apicast-staging           1          1         1         config,image(amp-apicast:latest)
apicast-wildcard-router   1          1         1         config,image(amp-wildcard-router:latest)-
-----

It is technically feasible that your backend services, if they were to be  co-located in the same cluster as the API Manager, could be managed by these default API Manager gateways.

One practical hinderance however is that these gateways are owned by the 3scale master user and the OCP cluster-admin.
You, as a non cluster-admin,  do not have the ability to bounce these gateways, nor modify them if need be.

It also would be difficult to identify your logs while everyone's traffic flows through those gateways at the same time.

These default API Manager gateways are of minimal value to you.

=== Tenant specific API Gateways

Your lab environment comes pre-provisioned with a set of API gateways that are specific to your tenant.
You have full administrative access to your tenant specific API gateways.
These are the API gateways that you will use to manage your backend services for the duration of this course.

. You can get a list of these API gateways by executing the following:
+
-----
$ oc get deploy -n $GW_PROJECT


NAME            DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
prod-apicast    1         0         0            0           7h
stage-apicast   1         0         0            0           7h
-----

. Notice the value of _$THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT_ has already been set for you in each of your gateways:
+
-----
$ oc describe deploy prod-apicast -n $OCP_USERNAME-gw | grep THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT

      THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT:    https://b753490aa7586f8e0663f5d5ec62b63cf9e71540d9138e4869eede4446e8e871@user1-3scale-mt-amp0-admin.apps.3295.openshift.opentlc.com
-----
+
The API Gateway uses the value of _THREESCALE_PORTAL_ENDPOINT_ invoke the API Manager and retrieve details of your APIs.

. Resume the paused deploy objects:
+
-----
$ oc rollout resume deploy stage-apicast prod-apicast -n $GW_PROJECT
